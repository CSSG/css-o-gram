# CSS-o-Gram (CSSG)
> rapid, intuitive, neat - like [SSG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steyr_SSG_69), but peaceful

## Overview

CSSG stands for "CSS Diagram", in fact - a comment block in CSS file, which describes substance structure with CSS classes. Substance can be element, block or project, depending on methodology that you do (or _do not_) use.

This is your trusted companion in large project and assistant for your colleages, if you work in team.

Low entry barriers - use regular syntax and some logical rules.  
However, it's implied that you familiar with [BEM](http://ru.bem.info/method/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), [MCSS](https://github.com/operatino/MCSS) etc. and perhaps already use any of theese methodologies.  
If not, you could possibly hear about [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and other frameworks.  
Either way it is recommended to get yourself acquainted with [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) terminology _before_ further reading.

## For whom and for what

* Better code structure and getting into new code
* Conversation tool for colleages and developers, distant from front-end
* Detecting potential "bottlenecks" in layout (excessive DOM nesting, classes amount etc.)
* Easier debugging and refactoring
* It's just pretty!
