Substance can be element, block or project, depending on methodology that you do (or _do not_) use.\r\n\r\nThis is your trusted companion in large project and assistant for your colleages, if you work in team.\r\n\r\nLow entry barriers - use regular syntax and some logical rules.  \r\nHowever, it's implied that you familiar with [BEM](http://ru.bem.info/method/), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), [MCSS](https://github.com/operatino/MCSS) etc. and perhaps already use any of theese methodologies.  \r\nIf not, you could possibly hear about [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and other frameworks.  \r\nEither way it is recommended to get yourself acquainted with [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) terminology _before_ further reading.\r\n\r\n## For whom and for what\r\n\r\n* Better code structure and getting into new code\r\n* Conversation tool for colleages and developers, distant from front-end\r\n* Detecting potential \"bottlenecks\" in layout (excessive DOM nesting, classes amount etc.)\r\n* Easier debugging and refactoring\r\n* It's just pretty!\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nGet to know first part of CSSG documentation - [basic](https://github.com/CSSG/css-o-gram/blob/master/basic.md)  \r\nEasy enough - try it and continue reading - [advanced](https://github.com/CSSG/css-o-gram/blob/master/advanced.md)  \r\nSyntax legend - [legend](https://github.com/CSSG/css-o-gram/blob/master/legend.md)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n## CSSG generator\r\n\r\nOf course it's far more handy to get into into CSSG using automatic generator.\r\nCheck out [CSSG converter](https://github.com/CSSG/css-o-gram_tool)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask questions via [email](mailto:stewiekillsloiss@gmail.com).  \r\nAll content is available for free distribution.  \r\n[Link to source](https://github.com/CSSG/css-o-gram) is mandatory when copying materials.\r\n","google":"UA-41591276-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
